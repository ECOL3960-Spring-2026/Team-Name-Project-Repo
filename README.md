## Project Description:   
We intend to test for any correlations between discharge, fish abundance, and aquatic 
plant abundance at the Upper Big Creek (BIGC) and Teakettle Creek (TECR) NEON sites. We 
hypothesize that both fish abundance and plant abundance will be lower at times of lower 
average stream discharge or immediately following times of lower average stream discharge 
due to a decrease in resources and space. Additionally, due to the refugia from predators 
that aquatic plants provide to fish, we hypothesize that lower plant abundance will result 
in lower fish abundance, regardless of average stream discharge. These variables will be 
analyzed over a ten year period from 2012 to 2022, testing our two hypotheses individually. 
For our first hypothesis, we will examine the relationship between stream discharge and fish 
abundance, then the relationship between stream discharge and plant abundance. For our second 
hypothesis, we will examine the relationship between plant abundance and fish abundance. 

## Data Description:   
We plan on using the following datasets from the NEON data portal: Fish electrofishing, 
gill netting, and fyke netting counts (DP1.20107.001), Discharge field collection (DP1.20048.001), 
and Aquatic plant, bryophyte, lichen, and macroalgae point counts in wadeable streams (DP1.20072.001). 
All three of the datasets we are using have data found at the Upper Big Creek (BIGC) and Teakettle 
Creek (TECR) NEON sites. The “Fish electrofishing, gill netting, and fyke netting counts” dataset 
has information on fish species count from three different methods of collection, which will allow 
us to make a new dataset on fish abundance over time. The “Discharge field collection” dataset has 
stream discharge data over time. A data point is taken once every 15 minutes, so we will be able to 
create a new dataset with average stream discharge on specific timescales. Finally, the “Aquatic 
plant, bryophyte, lichen, and macroalgae point counts in wadeable streams” dataset has data on 
aquatic plant counts from streams, which will allow us to make a new dataset on aquatic plant 
abundance over time.
