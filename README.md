###Project Describtion:
We want to test if there is a correlation between discharge, and aquatic plant 
and fish abundance within two sites located at NEON data sites BIGC and TECR. We 
hypothesize that the fish abundance will be lower in times of lower discharge
due to need to find refuge from predators and seek stable temperatures
